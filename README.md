# ElhoDiscordBot
Elho is a little bot for Discord I made with [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)

# Commands
Elho is currently packed with some commands:
Command  | Function
------------- | -------------
?hi  | Elho says Hello!
?info  | Displays information about Elho
?cmd | Displays all usable commands
?clear | Clears a certain ammount of messages

# UsageOfCode
Feel free to use the source code of this bot either standalone (more features will be added in the future) or to add to your own Project.

# Contributing
If you have an idea for a feature just open an issue or implement it yourself ;)

Also if you find something in the code that doesnt seem right to you just open an issue and I will have a look at it.
